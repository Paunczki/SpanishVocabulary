Since this is going to be a chrome extension, 
I may want to split the words into a dataset in javascript
But I might want to save to local chrome storage.
Saving to local chrome extension will be easier to access in the future 
and I doubt a small datastructure will take up a lot of space
    -> Want to make it generic where it does not depend on language/list 
       of words so I can repeat for Russian
I could also make a server with a database but that will be for future use


I then will need to work on a user interface that looks nice 


I also need to take into consideration how I am going to save what words a 
user does well on or has completed and such
